# Rainbow's Beginning

Mixed Reality/Layered Reality/Augmented Reality

Rainbow's Beginning explores how we might implement a framework for ubiquitious augmented reality in geographically specific locations.
By creating layers of reality that are subscribable with different access priveleges for different communities, it may be possible have 'shared truths' versus 'personalized experience' through virtual mediation.
We are also interested in how IOT sensors and smart-city architectures can be leveraged to better situate and provide environmental context to different layers, and how that information will be incorporated into the design of the user interfaces and interactions.
